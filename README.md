# Hybrid Long-Term Multi-Object Tracking (HLT-MOT)

## Overview

This project implements a robust multi-object tracking system designed to maintain consistent object identities over extended periods, particularly addressing challenges like occlusions and re-appearance. It combines the efficiency of short-term tracking with the discriminative power of deep learning-based re-identification (Re-ID).

**Core Functionality:**

1.  **Short-Term Tracking:** Utilizes DeepSORT (`deep_sort_realtime`) for frame-to-frame association based on motion (Kalman filter) and appearance similarity (DeepSORT's internal metric).
2.  **Appearance Embedding:** Employs DINOv2 ViT-B model (via PyTorch) to extract robust visual appearance features (768-dim embeddings) for each detected object.
3.  **Online Re-Identification:** When a new track appears, its features are compared against a gallery of features from recently *inactive* tracks. If a strong match (low cosine distance) is found, the existing ID is reassigned, enabling tracking through short occlusions or detection failures.
4.  **Offline Re-Identification Refinement:** Periodically (every `re_id_interval` frames), the system compares active tracks with inactive ones. If strong appearance similarity suggests a fragmented track (same object assigned multiple IDs), the older ID is merged into the current active one, consolidating identity history.
5.  **Temporal Association:** Maintains track history and simple motion prediction (linear velocity) to aid in association, especially as a secondary cue for Re-ID.

## The Math Behind the Magic: How It Works

### Object Detection

Object detection is the first step in our tracking pipeline, using YOLOv11 (You Only Look Once), which:

1. **Divides** the image into a grid (typically 13×13 or larger)
2. **Predicts** bounding boxes with confidence scores for each grid cell
3. **Applies** Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to remove overlapping detections

Each detection is represented as a vector `[x1, y1, x2, y2, confidence, class_id]`, where:
- `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are the top-left and bottom-right coordinates
- `confidence` is the detection probability (0-1)
- `class_id` is the object category (e.g., 0 for person)

### Feature Extraction

For each detected object, we extract a unique visual signature using DINOv2 ViT-B/14:

1. **Crop** the detected object from the original frame
2. **Preprocess** with normalization: `(pixel - mean) / std` where `mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]` and `std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`
3. **Extract** a 768-dimensional feature vector using DINOv2
4. **Normalize** the vector to unit length (L2 normalization): 
   
```math
f_{normalized} = \frac{f}{||f||_2} = \frac{f}{\sqrt{f_1^2 + f_2^2 + \dots + f_{768}^2}}
```

This transforms each object into a compact "visual fingerprint" that captures its appearance while being robust to small changes in lighting, pose, or viewpoint.

### Short-term Tracking with DeepSORT

DeepSORT combines two key components to track objects between consecutive frames:

1. **Kalman Filtering** - A motion prediction algorithm that:
   - Maintains a state vector `x = [center_x, center_y, aspect_ratio, height, velocity_x, velocity_y, ...]`
   - Predicts future position using linear motion model: `x_predicted = F·x + noise`
   - Updates predictions based on new measurements: `x_updated = x_predicted + K·(measurement - H·x_predicted)`
   
   Here, `F` is the state transition matrix, `H` maps state to measurement space, and `K` is the Kalman gain that balances prediction vs. measurement.

2. **Data Association** - Matches detections to existing tracks using both motion and appearance:
   - Computes cost matrix `C` combining motion and appearance distances
   - For each element: `C[i,j] = λ·motion_distance + (1-λ)·appearance_distance`
   - Solves the assignment problem using the Hungarian algorithm (finding optimal pairing that minimizes total cost)

This combination allows reliable frame-to-frame tracking under ideal conditions.

### Long-term Re-identification

When objects disappear and reappear (due to occlusion or leaving the frame), we need to recognize them:

1. **Feature Gallery** - For each tracked object, we maintain:
   - A queue of up to `gallery_size` (e.g., 1000) feature vectors from past appearances
   - Last seen frame information

2. **Online Re-ID** - When a new track appears:
   - Compare its feature vector against all feature galleries of inactive tracks
   - Compute cosine distance: `d = 1 - (feature1·feature2)/(||feature1||·||feature2||)`
   - If minimum distance < threshold (e.g., 0.2), assign the previous ID

3. **Batch Re-ID Refinement** (every `re_id_interval` frames):
   - Compute distances between all active and inactive track galleries in a single GPU operation
   - Form a distance matrix `D` where `D[i,j]` is the minimum distance between features of active track `i` and inactive track `j`
   - Sort potential matches by increasing distance
   - Merge tracks if minimum distance < threshold (e.g., 0.2)

This allows objects to maintain consistent identity even after long periods out of view.

### Temporal Association Refinement

To handle challenging cases, we use temporal information:

1. **Track History** - Store the last 50 positions of each object
2. **Motion Prediction** - Estimate future position based on recent velocities:
   - `velocity = positions[1:] - positions[:-1]`
   - `avg_velocity = mean(velocity)`
   - `predicted_position = last_position + avg_velocity`
3. **Use predictions** to improve matching for objects that briefly disappear

### Performance Optimization

The system uses several techniques to maintain real-time performance:

1. **Batch Processing** - Feature extraction for multiple objects in a single GPU operation
2. **GPU Acceleration** - Distance calculations for feature matching using CUDA operations
3. **Parallel Computing** - When appropriate, parallel processing of independent operations

## System Architecture Flow

For each frame:

1.  **Detect:** Objects are detected using an upstream detector (e.g., YOLOv11 via `YOLODetector`).
2.  **Update DeepSORT:** Detections are passed to `deep_sort_realtime` for Kalman prediction and association based on motion/appearance.
3.  **Process Tracks:** Confirmed tracks from DeepSORT are processed.
4.  **Extract Features:** For relevant tracks, appearance features are extracted using the `FeatureExtractor` (DINOv2).
5.  **Map IDs & Re-ID:**
    *   If a track ID is new from DeepSORT, attempt **Online Re-ID** against inactive track feature galleries.
    *   Assign a consistent system ID (either re-identified or new).
6.  **Update State:** Add current features to the track's gallery (`feature_gallery`), update last seen frame, and manage active/inactive status.
7.  **Offline Refinement (Periodic):** If `frame_count % re_id_interval == 0`, perform **Offline Re-ID Refinement** to merge fragmented tracks.
8.  **Predict Motion:** Update simple motion predictions for tracks.
9.  **Output:** Return list of active tracks: `[x1, y1, x2, y2, consistent_id, class_id]`.

## Key Components

*   **`HybridTracker`:** Main class managing the overall tracking logic, integrating DeepSORT and the custom Re-ID mechanisms.
*   **`FeatureExtractor`:** Handles loading the DINOv2 ViT-B model, image preprocessing (resize, normalize), and extracting L2-normalized feature embeddings using PyTorch.
*   **`YOLODetector`:** Wrapper for object detection (supports `ultralytics` YOLOv11+ or OpenCV DNN YOLOv4 as fallback).
*   **`deep_sort_realtime`:** External library providing the underlying DeepSORT algorithm.

## Performance Profiling

The system includes built-in performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks:

1. **Function-level Profiling** - Measures execution time of key functions
2. **Bottleneck Analysis** - Identifies the most time-consuming operations
3. **Optimization Recommendations** - Provides suggestions for performance improvement

Common bottlenecks include:
- Feature extraction (GPU memory transfers)
- Batch feature comparison during Re-ID
- YOLO detection on higher-resolution frames

## Configuration

Key parameters for `HybridTracker`:

*   `max_cosine_distance` (float, default: 0.25): DeepSORT's appearance threshold (lower = stricter match). With DINOv2 features, a lower value (0.25) works well.
*   `max_age` (int): Max frames DeepSORT keeps a track without association. *Crucial for occlusion handling.* (Dynamically calculated in `main()` based on FPS and target occlusion time - typically set to handle 5 second disappearances).
*   `min_confidence` (float, default: 0.3): Minimum detection confidence threshold.
*   `re_id_interval` (int, default: 5): How often (in frames) to run offline Re-ID refinement. Lower values (5-10) work well with the efficiency of DINOv2.
*   `gallery_size` (int, default: 1000): Max features stored per track for custom Re-ID.
*   `model_path` (str | None): Optional path to a custom Re-ID model. Default uses DINOv2 ViT-B/14.

## How the Re-ID Similarity Works: An Intuitive Explanation

When deciding if two object detections are the same object, the system calculates how "similar" they look using cosine similarity. Think of each object's feature vector as an arrow pointing in a specific direction in a high-dimensional space:

1. **Similar objects** have feature arrows pointing in nearly the same direction, resulting in a small angle between them (high cosine similarity, low distance).
2. **Different objects** have feature arrows pointing in different directions, resulting in a larger angle (low cosine similarity, high distance).

For example:
- If two detections of the same person wearing the same clothes have a cosine distance of 0.12 (very similar)
- Two different people might have a cosine distance of 0.75 (very different)
- The system uses a threshold (e.g., 0.25) to decide: "below this, I'm confident it's the same object"

The DINOv2 transformer-based architecture creates these feature vectors that are remarkably good at focusing on the important visual aspects while ignoring irrelevant variations.

## Limitations

*   **Computational Load:** Detection + DeepSORT + DINOv2 feature extraction is computationally demanding.
*   **Parameter Tuning:** Performance depends on careful tuning of `max_age`, distance thresholds, etc.
*   **Detector Reliant:** Tracking quality is capped by the upstream detector's performance.
*   **Appearance Similarity:** Very similar-looking objects (e.g., identical twins, same uniform) can still cause ID switches.
*   **Long-term Changes:** Objects that drastically change appearance over time may be difficult to re-identify.

## Potential Future Enhancements

*   Fine-tune the DINOv2 Re-ID model on domain-specific data (e.g., person or vehicle datasets).
*   Implement more advanced motion models (e.g., social force models for pedestrians).
*   Explore graph-based optimization for offline association.
*   Add camera-to-camera (multi-view) re-identification capabilities.
*   Incorporate scene context understanding for improved predictions.
